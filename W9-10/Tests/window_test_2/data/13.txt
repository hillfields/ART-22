I recently found an online game where I could interact with other people. Itâ€™s one of those games where the main objective is killing monsters. The game allows for multiplayer, which means players join guilds and band together to defeat monsters. While fighting, players can talk to each other using the in-game message board. What I liked about it is that there is no pressure to keep up looks. It also made communicating with other people easier since I had time to think about what I could say.

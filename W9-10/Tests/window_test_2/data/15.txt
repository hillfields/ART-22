It’s hard to leave the game unless it’s to poop or eat. To minimize the amount of time I go outside my room, I only use the bathroom when I really have to (which is at most twice a day). I also started eating one meal every day. My mom still leaves leftovers in the fridge, so I warm up some food in the microwave when it’s around midnight. I could care less what I’m eating, as long as I’m putting something in my stomach.

For the past few days, I’ve just been mindlessly browsing the Internet. My mom isn’t at home most of the day since she still has her job, so I pretty much have the house to myself. I’m useless when it comes to cooking, so I only eat crackers and cup noodles for lunch. I don’t have much of a desire to go outside either. I felt safer at home where I’m not pressured to do anything.

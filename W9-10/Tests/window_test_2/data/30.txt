After interviewing with the convenience store, I was notified that I had gotten the job. Even though it was part-time, I felt that it would give me less pressure than my previous job. I’ll probably keep going to the future group therapy sessions for a while. Maybe I can find a full-time job sometime down the road, but for now I’ll take my time.

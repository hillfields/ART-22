Starting today, I will start writing journal entries. I heard about this from one of my co-workers while we were eating lunch together. She told me that whenever she was stressed (which was almost every day), she would start jotting down her thoughts in a journal. She said it was cathartic because it was like venting to an imaginary person. I thought that sounded interesting, but writing everything down by hand sounded like a pain. She suggested that I use a computer if I wanted to type it out instead, and I told her I’d try it out. I don’t think I’ll record my thoughts often, but let’s see how it goes.

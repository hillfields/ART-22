One of my friends from back in college messaged me to see if I wanted to get something to eat sometime. I hadn’t had any contact with anyone else besides my mom in the past month, but even the conversations with my mom felt detached. I didn’t know how to respond to my friend, but the thought of having to talk to someone who I hadn’t interacted with in a while was nerve-wracking. In my mind, he seemed more like a stranger. It took me a few hours to respond, but I ended up saying that I was too busy with work. It was the only reasonable excuse I could come up with, even though it was a complete lie.

It’s a bit embarrassing to say, but I still live with my mom. When I first got my job, I thought it was cheaper and more convenient if I lived with her. She would always make dinner for me when I came home, and she would put food in the fridge if I had to work overtime. It’s been a few days since I left my job, but I still haven’t told my mom about it yet. She’s under the impression that I’m taking a few days off because I’m sick. Maybe I should tell her soon.

I watched a documentary about hikikomori today. I went into thinking that I could maybe relate to someone out there who was like me. But then I saw people in their 50’s living with their parents in their 80’s, people who’ve stayed inside for decades. That’s when the thoughts started flooding. How long was I planning to stay inside? Am I going to spend the rest of my life in this room? And what about my mom? She can’t take care of me forever. What if she died? I’d probably die as well. I don’t want a future like that.

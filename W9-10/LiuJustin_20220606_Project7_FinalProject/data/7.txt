I finally told my mom that I quit my job. I tried to phrase it so it didn’t seem that serious, but she was worried about me. She asked me why, and I told her it was because I was too tired when I came home. She had a slight frown on her face, but she didn’t seem mad in the slightest (then again, I rarely saw her get mad). She said that I could stay in the house while I was looking for another job.

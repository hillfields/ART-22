I was yelled at by my boss today. I get scolded every now and then, but today was particularly bad. I had mistakenly believed that the deadline for submitting an important document was tomorrow, but it turned out to be yesterday. My boss made sure that everyone in the office could hear his anger. All the while, I just wished that I could hide from the world and not have to think about anything.

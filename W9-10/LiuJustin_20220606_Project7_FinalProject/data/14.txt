I got addicted to the game to the point where I’ve been playing it during every waking moment. It’s admittedly fun to complete quests with my guild members, but a lot of the people I usually talk to are only online at night. There’s much less people online during the mornings and afternoons. Well, they probably have other obligations, so there’s no way around that. It’s not like they have the same amount of free time that I have.

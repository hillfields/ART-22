I went to a group therapy session today. There were other people who identified as hikikomori there as well, around 6 people. I think the idea was that if we were able to talk to other people like ourselves, then we would be able to increase our social interaction. We were told to talk about whatever we wanted, but when the session started, no one was willing to speak. It was difficult to start talking, especially with people I didn’t know. Even just introducing ourselves took some time. Most of the session was just pure silence. I don’t think it helped.

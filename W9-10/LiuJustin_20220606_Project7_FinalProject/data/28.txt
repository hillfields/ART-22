I still went to the group therapy sessions over the past few weeks. I think itâ€™s starting to get better. During the second session, one person must have thought that the silence was unbearable because he started talking about why he became a hikikomori. He found it difficult to secure a full-time job after working part-time for many years, which led to him losing confidence. Soon after, everyone else jumped in with their own stories, making it easier to talk. We gradually talked more and more with each other about our worries and whatnot. It felt cathartic.

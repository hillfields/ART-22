While I was looking for something to do, I remembered that I had some books I had bought out of curiosity on my bookshelf. I never got around to reading them since I didnâ€™t have the mental energy to do so after work. But now that I had a lot of time on my hands, reading seemed like a good way of passing time (better than Internet surfing, at least). I spent a few hours getting through a book. It was a nice change of pace.

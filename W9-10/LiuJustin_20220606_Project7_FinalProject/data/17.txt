I had a huge fight with my mom today. She caught me while I was walking back to my room during one of my rare bathroom breaks. She proceeded to nag at me, telling me that I was being unproductive doing who knows what in my room. Then she brought up the topic of looking for a job, which made me angry. I didn’t want to work. I didn’t want to be pressured to do things by other people. I shouted back at her and went back to my room, slamming the door.

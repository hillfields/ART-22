I’ve had a lot of time to reflect after being unemployed. On one hand, I was free from the harsh office life. But at the same time, I was basically contributing nothing to society now. I was essentially a freeloader. Even though my mom had told me to basically get another job, thinking about it only stressed me out. What was the point of me working if I wasn’t going to enjoy it? What was the point of me earning a paycheck if I was still living with my mom? What was the point of anything?

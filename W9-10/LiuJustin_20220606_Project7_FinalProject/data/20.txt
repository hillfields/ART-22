Everything I’ve been doing now always becomes boring after a while. I can’t finish any books. I can’t pay attention to music. I don’t feel like eating. I don’t feel like learning about anything. My mom has tried knocking on my door a few times asking if I should go to see a therapist, but I don’t have the energy to respond.
